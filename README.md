# Road-Accidents-Severinity
#About
This project will talk about different accidents which took place in different countries and get different insights and do predictive modelling.

#Motivation
Major motive of the project will be developing insights and prevention mechanisms for Traffic Accidents and Road Safety.  The data consists of detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents, the types of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties.

#Business Understanding
With help of this dataset we can find many inferences which have a business potential.
For instance we can think of getting information like main causes of accidents in different situations and countries and the severity of accidents in last few years.
With help of features we can predict accidents severity and places more prone to accidents helping in overall reduction of accidents.
